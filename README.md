## sameFilesScan.py
- The script reads specified directory top-down, searches same files, and writes .json document report. Currently, it is supports comparision within one directory and will be expanded in the future.
- In order to run the script, open **cmd** and run **>sameFilesScan.py <directory_path>** with the directory you would want to scan.
